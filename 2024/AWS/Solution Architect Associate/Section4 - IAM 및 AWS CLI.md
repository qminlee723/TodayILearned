# Section4: IAM 및 AWS CLI

## IAM: Users & Groups & Policies

### Users & Groups

- IAM = Identity and Access Management, Global Service
- Root account created by default, shouldn't be used or shared
- Users are people within your organization, and can be grouped
- Users don't have to belong to a group, and user can belong to multiple groups

### Permissions

- Users or Groups can be assigned JSON documents called policies
- These policies define the permissions of the users
- In AWS you apply **the least privilege principle**: don't give more permissions than a users needs
