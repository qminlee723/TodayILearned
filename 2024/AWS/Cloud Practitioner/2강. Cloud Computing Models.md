## Cloud Computing Models

- Infrastructure as a Service(IaaS)
  - Provides networking, computers, data storage space
  - 자유도는 높지만, 복잡
  - MS Azure등
- Platform as a Service(PaaS)
  - deployment and management of your applications
- Software as a Service(SaaS)
  - completed product that is run and managed by the service provider
  - Gmail, Slack, MS Office ... etc



## IaaS

- Basic building blocks for cloud IT and give access to networking features, computers(virtual or on dedicated hardware), and data storage space
- Highest level of flexibility and management control over your IT resources and is most similar to existing IT resources that many IT departments and developers are familiar with today
- Leaves the running of server instances to the customer, they do not access to what is on your servers



## PaaS

- No need to maintain underlying infrastructure(usually hardware and operating systems) and allow you to focus on the deployment and management of your applications
- Examples of SaaS include Amazon LightSail and AWS Elastic Beanstalk

| PaaS                              | YOU                 |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Resource procurement              | Focus on develop    |
| Capacity planning                 | Business managmenet |
| Software maintenance and patching |                     |



## SaaS

- Completed product that is run and managed by the service provider
- End-user applications like Gmail, iCloud
- You don't have to think about how the service is maintained or how the underlying infrastructure is managed; you only need to think about how you will use that particular piece of software



## Cloud Computing Deployment Models

### Public Cloud

- All parts of the application run in the cloud
- Six advantages of cloud computing



### Hybrid Cloud

- Control over sensitive assets in your private infrastructure
  - ID, SSD, PW, credit card information 
- Felxibility and cost-effectiveness of the public cloud



### Private Cloud(On Premise Cloud)

- Cloud services not exposed to the public
- Security for sensitive applications
