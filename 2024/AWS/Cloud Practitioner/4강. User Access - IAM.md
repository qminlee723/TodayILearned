## Users and Group

- AWS identity and Access Management(IAM) enables you to manage access to AWS services and resources securely
- Root User - created by **default**, **should not be used or shared**
- Groups - only contain users, not groups
- IAM User - can belong to multiple or no group

| Create an AWS account. This establishes your root user identity | Create your first IAM user and give it permissions to create other users | - Log in as the new IAM user and continue to create other users<br>- Only access the root user for a limited number of tasks |



## Permission and Policies

- **By default, IAM users have no permissions**
- Users can have JSON documnet called **policies** that allows or denies permissions to AWS services and resources
- **Least privilege principle**
  - only give permissions that you need



## Multi Factor Authentication

- protecting accounts with more than one source of authentication
- Password + MFA device
- Benefits of MFA
  - account is secure even if passwrod is stolen

- Virtual MFA



## AWS access

- AWS management Console - protected by password
- AWS command Line Interface(CLI) - protected by access keys
- AWS Software Development Kit (SDK) - protected by access keys
- Access Key ID = ID
- Secret Access Key = Password



## Roles

- Roles are identity that you can assume to gain temporary access to permissions
- IAM user, application, or service can assume an IAM role
